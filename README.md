# JFK
GEO OSINT


Description:
The president of the United States (1961-1963) John F. Kennedy was assasinated in 1963 for unknown reasons. A memorial of the president was placed in this location. Now your job is to find the exact location shown in the picture. Good luck.

Flag should be the exact coordinates of the location. Example UJCYC{12.1234567, 12.1234567}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After researching the incident, the first thing that comes to mind is to look inside the building where the assasin was located.
Which is the Texas Text Book Depositry - now known as The Dallas County Administration Building.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we have found the building, but the flag requires us to be in the exact location so we go into Google Maps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to get inside the building we use the street view tool provided by Maps and use the blue walk in track.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 To do so we drag and drop the dummy figure inside the building:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Move around the building and you'll find the exact required location.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get the coordinates we simply check the URL and match them with the requirements.

Here we see the coordinates as 32.7797809, -96.8084026, so the flag would be...


UJCYC{32.7797809, -96.8084026}
